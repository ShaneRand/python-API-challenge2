# python-api-challenge
Module 6 HW
Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

For this part, you'll use the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.

Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.

The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.

Your main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.

RESULTS
**Discussion about the linear relationship:** 
Temperature vs. Latitude - there's a strong correlation between the distance from the equator and the Max Temperature
    - The northern hemisphere has a strong positive correlation
    - The southern hemisphere has a strong positive correlation
Humidity vs. Latitude - little relationship between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with r-squared data of 0.05 and 0.002, respectively.
Cloudiness vs. Latitude - little relationship between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with r-squared data of 0.02 and 0.02, respectively.
Wind Speed vs. Latitude - little relationship between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with r-squared data of 0.03 and 0.06, respectively.
